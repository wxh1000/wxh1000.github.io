Some code of this site(mostly that generates list of posts by date/category/tag) is copied from [yihui.name](http://yihui.name) (@yihui)(Hope this is OK but leave a message if you mind.)

For now bootstrap is applied, though I prefer to use a simple solution, but I don't have time to dig into CSS and write a simple elegent **responsive*** design. Hope I can finish this later.

The last thing I'd like to do is coding in Windows.
