Some times I use [Stata](http://www.stata.com/), but I found no language definition available in package `listings`([url](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/listings/)), so I write a gist. Hope it useful.

Any contribution is highly welcomed. Feel free to fork it, or leave your coment.
